Each player of PUBG game has a specific skill set and can be categorized into 7 different class of play.
For example, a player who prefers long range attack and strategic positioning in gameplay is a sniping class of play. 

In order to classify a person into a specific class of play, 10 such features of the player are recorded.
Some of these features are the average number of time the player killed an enemy in the same house (which may indicate rushing into the enemy team or dissolving a rush), 
average kills by player played with other 3 teammates killed in squad match, etc.

In this repository, the players are classified into 1 out of 7 class of play, given the 10 features with each player.
